# nnp
Implemented a neural network system comprising of variable plus fixed inputs, weights and biases assigned to it.
Created a dot product matrix while transversing the weight matrix.
Coded a layer.
Created separate batches, layers and objects for neurons.
Initialised hidden layer activation function using sigmoid function, step function as well as rectfied linear function in order to achieve better optimisation.
Created a variable that denote no of points per class, dimensionality, number of classes.
With the help of modules namelu, "numpy", "nnfs", "matplotlib.pyplot" plotted a spiral diagram of distribution based on previous trained class.
